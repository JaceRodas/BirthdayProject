        <p>Dear my Angel Mae</p>
        <p>I know we've been through a lot of tiring problems and miscommunication, but look where we are now! We're still standing strong, and we're in our first month. I can't tell you how much I appreciate and treasure you. Please know that no matter what happens, I will always love and cherish you. Anytime you have a problem, I'll always be here for you, not because I "need" to but because I want to. Ill always be that one person who will always support you, and I will always be proud of you and your hard work. Even if it's a small achievement you did, I'll be very proud of you. I love you, darling; I really do.

            I love you so much, babi, for more years, and we'll stay strong.
            
            Happy 1st monthsary to us!
        </p>
